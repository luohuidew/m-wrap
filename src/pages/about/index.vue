        Located in Portland, Oregon, Weget is an online beauty buying platform that creates an interactive shopping environment where beauty lovers, Influencers, and brands can all engage. We create fun activities for engagement that allow our customers to get the products they love at a discount by engaging in a fun social way. We launch a variety of group-buys, flash sales, giveaways, and discount activities that keep the platform lively and engaging. You can even earn points toward products by posting on the platform and giving product reviews.

        We sell a variety of carefully curated luxury brands and trusted classics like Chanel, YSL, Urban Decay, Laura Mercier, Tom Ford, Mac, and NARs and more. We hope to add local brands to our online buying platform and help promote smaller Independent beauty brands.
