      What to pack for a beach trip
    </p>
    <p class="theme-content text-line-clamp-2">
      Everyone loves a good beach trip right?! I got so many requests and messages asking me to share what I packed / what my… beach vacay essentials are. My outfit above is one of my favorites from the trip, and I have rounded up some other essentials that I took with me as well. On beach trips, I always pack a big floppy straw hat to help protect me from the sun, and a big straw bag (shown in pic below) to hold all my stuff in for the beach. This is the bag I took to Hawaii recently and I loved it! I’ve actually had it for 2 years I think and they just restocked it. It’s such a good bag and can hold a lot but not be too heavy.Everyone loves a good beach trip right?!
